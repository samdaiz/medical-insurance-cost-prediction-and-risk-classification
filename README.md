# medical-insurance-cost-prediction-and-risk-classification
Built predictive models to forecast medical insurance costs and classify risk levels. Leveraged Lasso regression and KNN to identify key factors, including BMI, smoking, and region, supporting better insurer pricing and healthcare strategies.

This is a group project with up to 5 members in each group. Please prepare the report with the structure below:

## Part 0 Project Title, Group Member Names (1 pt), Contributions of Each Member (1 pt)
## Part I Introduction (+ Part 0 10%)
background of the business/research problems (1 pt)
at least one regression problem and one classification problem
what is the business/research question? (1 pt x2)
what is the DV? (1 pt x 2)
what are the potential IVs? (1 pt x2)
why is it important in business/research practice? (0.5 pt x2)
your hypotheses if any
## Part II Data Preparation and EDA (20%)
data source and summary of the data set 
the link of the data source (1 pt)
number of observations (1 pt)  and what each observation represents (1 pt)
each variable: variable description (1 pt) and variable type (1 pt)
EDA (univariate, bivariate, numerical and graphical, with outputs and comments on the outputs)
univariate: the outputs (2 pts)? comments on how the data was distributed (1 pt)? any missing values (0.5 pt)? any extreme outliers (0.5 pt)?
bivariate: the outputs (3 pts)? comments on how one variable is related to the other variable based on the output for each pair of variables (3 pts)?
data cleaning/preparation based on the above outputs/findings to deal with missing values, outliers, transformed variables, interaction terms etc. (5 pts)
## Part III Analysis and Findings (50%)
choose the proper techniques for each business question; variable selection & model building with the findings from Part II taken into consideration, compare and contrast the results using the evaluation and validation techniques covered in the course, the findings
Regression problem using Generalized Regression models (28%)
proper list of predictor terms with proper original predictors, transformed predictors, and interaction terms (3 pts)
variable selection using subset selection and shrinkage (5 pts x2), for each, report the results with
the selected predictor terms (1 pt x2)
the corresponding coefficient estimates (1 pt x2)
the cross-validated test errors (1 pt x2)
residual diagnosis (2 pts x2)
compare the results and determine the optimal regression model (2 pts)
based on the outputs of the optimal model, comment on the findings regarding the related business/research questions addressed in part I (3 pts)
Classification problem using Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, KNN (22%)
proper list of predictor terms with proper original predictors, transformed predictors, and interaction terms (3 pts)
find the "best"
logistic regression model: report the selected predictor terms and corresponding coefficients, the cross-validated test error, specificity, and sensitivity (5 pts)
LDA model: report the selected predictor terms, the cross-validated test error, specificity, and sensitivity (4 pts)
KNN: report the optimal K, the selected predictor terms, the cross-validated test error, specificity, and sensitivity (5 pts)
compare the results and determine the optimal classification model (2 pts)
based on the outputs of the optimal classification model, comment on the findings regarding the related business/research questions addressed in part I (3 pts)
## Part IV Conclusions and Recommendations (15/100)
Conclusion (9 pts) <br/> 
Recommendations for business/research decisions based on the analysis results (6 pts)
## Part V References (5/100)
This project will be held to the standards of publishable research, so proper citations and formatting are required.
